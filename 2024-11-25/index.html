                <h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>
                <p>You can use Pulse absolutely free for 30 days. After 30 days, we will charge the credit card you used
                    when you signed up. If you choose to cancel your account before your trial ends, your card will not
                    be charged.</p>

                <h3>What is a “Financial Account”?</h3>
                <p>Financial Accounts are a grouping of income and expense items that can be used for tracking or
                    reporting purposes. They're designed to be flexible and can be used to differentiate between bank
                    accounts, companies, individuals, or between personal and business entries.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Will I be able to cancel my account if I don't use Pulse?</h3>
                <p>Yes - you can cancel your account at any time. To cancel your account, go to your billing page and
                    click on “Please cancel my account” at the bottom of the page. The account owner is the only one who
                    can cancel an account. An email request to delete an account is not considered cancellation.</p>
